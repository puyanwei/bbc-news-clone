# bbc-news-clone

This is a clone of the [bbc news website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news) for practice! I'm using the latest newly released vue-cli 3. I will use CSS grid and a SASS auto compiler, and the website will be responsive. Not quite sure how many pages I will do, but I'll try and make the front page as accurate as possible.
